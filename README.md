# Line-follower

##Task requirement
The goal of this project is to construct a Line Follower Robot that uses a PID controller and has automatic calibration. The robot must be able to complete the designated circuit in a maximum of 35 seconds, while maintaining precision and efficiency in its line following performance.

## How it works
The robot is able to follow the line using the sensor and the PID controller uses the data to calculate the necessary adjustments to the robot's movement and direction. The robot's automatic calibration feature uses a single wheel to move the robot from left to right, allowing for precise adjustments and fine-tuning of the PID control parameters. This allows the robot to accurately follow the line, even in challenging conditions.
